together, they asked Him, saying, “Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?” And He said to them, “It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.”\r\n\r\nThe disciples had endured much and even witnessed the resurrected Lord, and yet what was on their minds was the pressing matter of Israel’s independence. They felt that this was a noble and worthy enough cause for this newfound authority that Jesus was talking about. \r\n\r\nOften as Christians and leaders, we have many pressing personal and national issues that we feel should be addressed with our newfound Kingdom authority. Israel had not been free for hundreds of years, and the disciples thought maybe it was time.\r\n\r\nI don’t know what it is for you. Maybe it’s a health issue, or it is a wayward child. Maybe it’s the financial situation of your people or the injustices that surround us. Maybe it’s the big culture wars raging on other continents that we are all worried will soon be battles to be fought where we are or other religious movements that are using every method to stop the movement of the Gospel.\r\n\r\nBut Jesus’ response was that this wasn’t our place and that the Father would deal with it. Ours was to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes and to become witnesses of Christ in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria and the ends of the earth.\r\n\r\nWhat is your Jerusalem? That’s most likely the city where you are planted. In my case, that’s Kampala in Uganda. But notice that the command was to be witnesses at four levels. Most churches and ministries have answered the call to their Jerusalem and stopped there! They may have all sorts of spiritualized responses, like “That’s not my calling,” “God told me to remain here,” “I don’t have the grace of multiplication,” “We are called to be a community church,” or “We don’t have the resources for international ministry.”\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t matter how spiritual you make it sound. You are simply resisting the call of our Lord to go to all nations. It seems like every ministry that has obeyed God and taken on this vision has been blessed through the generations. All the people who insist on being in one place soon run into problems.\r\n\r\nToday’s devotional is taken from the book EMBRACING REVIVAL: How to Plant, Grow and Multiply a Church into a Movement", "devotion_thumbnail": "images/devotions/devotional_Ia9JwXN.jpg"}}, {"model": "base_apmo.devotion", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "Royalty Will Stand Up For You", "theme_scripture": "I Samuel‬ ‭19‬:‭1‬-‭3‬ ‭NKJV", "content": "Now Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his servants, that they should kill David; but Jonathan, Saul's son, delighted greatly in David. So Jonathan told David, saying, \"My father Saul seeks to kill you. Therefore please be on your guard until morning, and stay in a secret place and hide. And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak with my father about you. Then what I observe, I will tell you.\"\r\n\r\nWhen God puts a vision in your heart, and you start living it out, sometimes it's going to be perceived as a threat to the establishment, and sometimes a decision will be made to eliminate you. Whereas in days past, all they could think of was killing, nowadays, we have many other types of \"killing.\" Depending on which institution or system you serve in, the killing comes dressed in different uniforms.\r\n\r\nIt could just be character assassination and mudslinging on social media and other spaces. People who have never met you or even listened to you are helped by others to make up their minds about you and how evil you are. They have already decided without evidence that you are a cult leader, or a thief, or adulterous, or something close. Or, you just find yourself in the tabloids, complete with photoshopped images of you in a compromised position.\r\n\r\nIf it's in institutions with linear authority structures, you will be put on \"katebe\" as we call it. You just don't get deployed. You show up for work every day and are given no assignment or specific office or project. Or it could be lawsuits that are designed to damage. While all of that should scare us, it's important to note that God has already raised Jonathans within the establishment to stand up for you, to protect and preserve you, and to pass on necessary information to you for your survival and, ultimately, the fulfillment of the vision you carry.\r\n\r\nJoseph was sent ahead through prison in Egypt to become part of the establishment as Prime Minister to save Israel's family from dying of hunger. Similarly, Moses was raised in the palace of Pharaoh as a prince of Egypt who would later come and deliver the Israelites. He was part of the establishment. When Jesus was crucified, it was Joseph, one of His discreet disciples who was part of the establishment who asked for the body to bury it, fulfilling the promise of His burial and resurrection. Paul was raised in the establishment. He called himself a Pharisee of Pharisees, only to become one of the greatest proclaimers of the Gospel to his generation after the persecution had left the apostles with little hope.\r\n\r\nWhen the church was at one of its lowest moments and in a state of decay, it took a priest called Martin Luther to accelerate the reformation. A layperson would not have achieved it. So, whatever \"killing\" has been plotted or is already in operation for you, fear not, for God has already raised a Jonathan for you in the establishment who'll protect you to protect the vision you carry. Just be on the lookout so you don't miss your Jonathans when they come.\r\n\r\nToday’s devotional is taken from the book Called To Greatness\r\n\r\n- Apostle Moses Mukisa", "devotion_thumbnail": "images/devotions/devotional_xiGQRXJ.jpg"}}, {"model": "base_apmo.events", "pk": 1, "fields": {"title": "New Dawn Camp 2025", "date": "2024-12-19", "description": "Camp at different locations on 1st January 2025", "link": "Three day camp at the beginning of the year", "event_thumbnail": "images/events/ndc.jpeg"}}, {"model": "base_apmo.events", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "Youth Conference", "date": "2024-12-21", "description": "Youth conference at WHJINJA", "link": "Conference for yoith", "event_thumbnail": "images/events/jcr.jpg"}}]
